# AskAway 2, The React Boogaloo❓

This project is a rework on the original [AskAway](https://github.com/khatrivarun/askaway) application which is completely built on React with Firebase (and Algolia for that sweet sweet searching!)

# Building and Running 🚀

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:
 - Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your system. Any version will work
 - Clone this project onto your system.
 - Run `npm i` in the project directory to install all the required dependencies to run this project.
 - Create a [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and add this application to your Firebase project. Obtain the required keys and refer [this configuration](https://github.com/khatrivarun/askaway_react/blob/dev/src/config/example.firebase.js) to connect your app to Firebase.
 - Create an [Algolia Project](https://www.algolia.com/) and refer [this configuration](https://github.com/khatrivarun/askaway_react/blob/dev/src/config/example.algola.js) to connect your application to Algolia.
 - Run `npm start` to start the development server on your system!


# Available React Scripts! 👨‍💻

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
